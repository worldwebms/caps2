Called to see who was our latest contact and was passed to Graham Redfern, the financial officer; set up a meeting to go down and discuss upgrading their site
Entry: 24/08/2016 17:05 by: Carol Funkenhauser
Met up with them and had a big involved meeting with all the higher-ups to discuss the website changes they would like made. Took notes and will proceed with a proposal
Entry: 05/12/2016 15:45 by: Carol Funkenhauser
Called Graham again for a followup, as he had requested me to do, but they've been too busy and won't be able to do anything until the new year...will follow up then.
