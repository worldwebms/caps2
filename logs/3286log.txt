We still host their site, called the general manager and he didn't wanna talk (old dinosaur who didn't care about website) but pointed me to Juliet Tripodi, the director; she didn't pick up on her mobile, will follow up

Juliet is not interested in any further development on the website, as they don't require any fancy functionalities for it

We now host their website thanks to 7c.
