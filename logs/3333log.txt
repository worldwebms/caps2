I met Bill Marles at a Enterprise Adelaide networking event, and he passed along this lead, since it's development based. I then spoke to Jacky, who is using a cheap 3rd party online booking system, but he's not very happy with it and would like to expand into franchising, so he needs a better system. 
I set up a meeting to discuss.

Met up with Jacky for a workshop and he seemed fairly progressive, though young and with some clear solid monetary backing behind him (the clinic looks like it had a lot of capital put into it). 
He asked for a quote, and we'll take it from there.
