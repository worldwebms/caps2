Hi Chris,
I was referred to you by Brian Jackway from Enterprise Adelaide at the City Council.
I am a newly arrival migrant from Brazil working for Body Solid, based out of Chicago USA, and we are planning to set up an online retail operation out of SA to sell fitness equipment all across Australia. So at this point we are looking for potential partners vendor for this online operation and all IT infrastructure it will require.
Is this something you could help me with?
Thanks,
